# Principles of Programming Language Project

This will be the repository for our codes for PPL.

alphalex is our file currently FILE handling pa lang laman niya.
lexiana has the codes we need, naiayos ko na rin yan na gumagana na yung identifier. problema lang is di pa niya nababasa yung delimiters.
alphareader keme lang to pinageexperimentuhan ko codes

Updates:
01/27/22 : alphalex.c can now read files. lahat ng content ng file naililipat na sa char array aka Strings

To be done:
- yung laman ng file seems to be not being converted in a char array (string). find a way na maging char array yung content ng file, para tanggapin siya ng lexical analyzer natin. yung identifier ng lexical analyzer fixed na (ata). try to make the file run and see ano pang kulang (transfer the contents of lexiana to alphalex). read and understand the code. refresh your knowledge in c. pasahan na ng first revision guys tomorrow. thank you :>

02/08/2022 : alphareader.c is now our primary file many features are now integrated in it. refurnishing na lang.
